## About the Project

The TrafficAndRoutePrediction-NAV_AI project aims to provide route prediction and traffic management capabilities using Python. It leverages various data sources, including historical traffic data, real-time traffic updates, and sensor data, to generate accurate predictions and optimize route recommendations.

The project's workflow involves several key steps:

1. **Data Gathering**: Relevant data is collected from multiple sources, such as traffic sensors, GPS devices, and historical traffic databases. This data provides valuable insights into traffic flow, congestion, road conditions, and other factors influencing route selection.

2. **Machine Learning Analysis**: Machine learning algorithms, such as deep learning models like LSTMs or graph convolutional networks (GCNs), are employed to analyze the collected data and generate predictions. These models learn patterns and relationships from historical data to predict future traffic conditions and route outcomes.

3. **Real-Time Updates Integration**: The predictions are combined with real-time traffic updates to further refine and adjust the recommended routes. This ensures that the system adapts to changing traffic conditions and provides the most accurate and up-to-date information to users.

4. **Visualization and User Interaction**: Interactive maps and data visualizations are utilized to visualize the results. Users can view predicted routes, traffic congestion levels, alternative routes, and estimated travel times. Real-time notifications or alerts about significant traffic incidents or changes may also be provided.

## Steps to Use the Project

To use the TrafficAndRoutePrediction-NAV_AI project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub project by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/praTeek271/TrafficAndRoutePrediction-NAV_AI.git
